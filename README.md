# Digital-Village-Project
Worked on developing an Android App and web application which helps the rural administration to supervise over the village digitally. Implemented covid vaccination module for easy track of covid cases over the village.


## Problem statement

The purpose of this project is to build a mobile application to aid in the everyday
working of the village panchayat. It is an application aimed to simplify complicated
procedures such as announcements, complaint registration, payments, records of
villagers, etc. within the village. It is built primarily to keep in view the working of the
Panchayat and the requirements of the villagers.
Additionally, a vaccination micro-service will be incorporated with the general
digital village app through which the village admin will be able to track, edit and update
the Covid Vaccination details of every member in the village. Analysis updates related
to current affairs say the spread of the new Covid variant shall be published so as to
also work as a holistic local news medium. Mechanisms to send out personal
notifications regarding vaccination camp information to the villagers shall also be
implemented.
This way, the app shall serve the purpose of an all-in-one platform customized to
suit the needs of the rural community in an area.
